# AI-Web-Scrapper
Notes
1. Creating a Streamlit User Interface
This UI makes it easier to interact with LLM's
2. Grab DATA from the website that we want to scrape (Using Selenium)
Selenium allows to Automate a Web Browser so we can navigate to a webpage and grab its content and pass it through a LLM 
We can then use that LLM to parse through the DATA 

 Download Ollama
